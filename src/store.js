    title: 'Barbell Push Press',
    description: `This press allows you to load up the most weight
    (or do more reps) above all other overhead pressing moves.
    It's considered a bit more of a whole-body movement for developing
    explosiveness, so you lose some of the isolation effect if you do this
    same movement seated.`,

    id: 'Standing Military Press',
    title: 'Standing Military Press',
    description: `This is essentially a push press without the extra bit of
    body English generated through your legs. That makes it a better isolation
    movement, but this movement still isn't considered an isolation exercise.
    In fact, it's a highly demanding multijoint overhead press that, because it's
    not seated, still allows for a bit of momentum as well as increased muscle
    activation compared to the seated version.`,

    title: 'Bench Dips',
    description: `Bench dips are a great place to start if you don't have the
    strength yet to do a parallel bar dip. If you're totally new to strength
    training, you may need to start off with your feet on the floor and your
    hands on the bench behind you. If you've got a good level of strength,
    you can elevate your feet on another bench to make the movement more
    difficult. Increase the difficulty further by placing some weight on
    your lap.`,

    id: 'barbell-curls',
    title: 'Standing Barbell Curls',
    description: `Why it's great: Aside from the multijoint chin-up,
    this is the best overall biceps exercise there is. If you go back
    to our previous article detailing the 10 best biceps exercises,
    you'll see that EMG research ranked this movement toward the middle
    of the pack. So why all the love here? Because while seated versions
    such as the preacher and concentration curl may offer a greater
    EMG signal, you can use a much heavier load in the standing position!`,

    id: 'Flat Bench Dumbbell Press',
    title: 'Dumbbell Press',
    description: `With dumbbells, each side of your
    body must work independently, which recruits
    more stabilizer muscles; dumbbells are harder
    to control than a barbell.`,

    title: 'Dumbbell Bench Press',
    description: `Dumbbell bench presses are a common variation of the
    gold-standard barbell bench press, offering a suitable alternative
    if you want a slightly different training stimulus.
    But dumbbells are harder to control than a barbell.
    This may reduce the amount of weight you can use, while offering a
    slightly longer range of motion.`,

    title: 'Pull Ups',
    description: `Every muscle group has a gold-standard exercise for strength
    and growth. These time-tested compound movements form the backbone of any
    training regimen. When it comes to back training, no exercise can equal
    the pull-up for effectiveness and versatility.

    Despite its usefulness, the same big guys who jump at the chance to get
    under the bar for a bench press shy at the thought of jumping up to a
    pull-up bar. Yeah, pull-ups are tough. Sure, you might be bad at them.
    But everybody has to start somewhere.`,

    description: `The deadlift is where it all gets serious in the weight room.
    There are so many moving parts, and so many things to remember,
    that plenty of lifters would rather just skip it altogether.
    The number of people who claim that deadlifts "ruined their back"
    doesn't help anything, either.`,

    title: 'Squats',
    description: `Squats are often called the king of exercisesâ€”and for
    good reason. Squats work the largest muscles in the body, the thighs,
    and so they not only stimulate serious gains in muscular size and
    strength but also provide a systemic metabolic stimulation that seems
    to encourage even upper-body growth.`,

    dumbbells as described above or with a barbell

    is better suited for the advanced athletes
    who have mastered the exercise and no longer
    have balance issues.`,
